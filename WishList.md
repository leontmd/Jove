This is a wishlist for D3-based animation to be supported within Jove. The ones
with "*" may be cooler and more useful.

1) Make the language operations "livelier" by animating it (e.g., Star application)

2) Animate DFAs by marching tokens through them

3) Animate tokens marching via an NFA (*)

4) Animate NFA 2 DFA conversion (subset construction)  (*)

5) Animate PDA acceptance, showing the ND options (*)

6) Animate CFG parsing (bottom-up reduction or top-down derivation)

7) Animate DTMs and NDTMs simulating (*)

8) Animate PCP puzzles being solved; shuffle tiles with repetitions
